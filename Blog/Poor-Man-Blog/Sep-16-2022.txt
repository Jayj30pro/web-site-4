Fate is not your friend.
Some people want to believe anything negative is the world's will. It is easier to believe that the world gives you no say over your own life. No thought is required when everything is predetermined. Many people head towards the easy option, not knowing that easy now means hard later. It is hard to face obstacles now and take responsibility for those actions. The difficult path is understanding that everyone is responsible for the events and actions in their life, but the difficult path now leads to an easy life later. Some extreme situations are exceptions to the norm, but they are simply exceptions. Most people quickly avoid the idea that our position in life is mostly from our actions. Fate has little to no input on the quality of one's life. Instead, it is the actions a person takes that determine their future. Different attitudes and mindsets will lead to different styles of life and different levels of life quality.
