This blog discusses the financial decisions that separate the rich from the poor. As I keep learning more about financial literacy, I see more and more mistakes I have made in the past. These stories are from my personal experiences through life and how I look at those situations today. I will analyze these past experiences and offer suggestions for anyone who may find a similar situation in the future. Many financial mistakes are a result of something called the "poor man's mindset." The poor man's mindset is almost like a sickness that spreads throughout communities and slowly eats away at the wealth of everyone in the area. The poor man's mindset and a lack of financial education are the main reasons the poor stay poor.

Welcome to the poor man's chronicles.
