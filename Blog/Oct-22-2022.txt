Getting Ready.
I had never used a soldering iron before and thought I understood the concept. I had acquired an old soldering iron years ago and decided to find out if it worked by welding some wires to the DVD motors. It was about this time I realized that I did not have any solder and the soldering iron alone could not get the job done. I realized I would need more supplies like screws, brackets, and solder to fasten everything together. I reviewed all the YouTube videos that build a 3d printer using DVD motors so I could take note of the fastening options. I was nuts and bolts, screws, and glue as a common theme. I decided on a metal frame and nuts and bolts with washers to tighten everything together. With my new plan, I went to my local home improvement store and purchased nuts and bolts, washers, one metal sheet, a bar, and a hack saw.
