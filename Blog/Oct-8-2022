Rest of the Motors
I found that not all DVD drives use stepper motors to control the laser. I learned that DVD-RW drives seem to have stepper motors, so I decided to look for more computers. I returned to my local pawn shop, searching for old desktops with a DVD-RW drive to get more motors for the rest of the printer. The shop only had one, so I had to expand my search to the nearby pawnshops. I then found a computer for $10 that had been dropped on the floor and did not work. Since the disc drive was enclosed in metal, I knew it was still OK. I took both the old computers apart and found two more stepper motors. I noticed that each motor was attached to a rectangular metal frame with a metal buffer on all sides. I became concerned that the metal frame might interfere with the Z-axis. I decided to try a floppy disc drive that does not have the same frame problem as the DVD-RW. One computer had a floppy drive that could work for the printer. The real challenge would be connecting wires and using a soldering iron for the first time.
