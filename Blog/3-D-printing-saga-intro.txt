Welcome to 
The 3-D Printing Saga.
It all started during the beginning of the 2020 pandemic. I decided that I was going to get into 3-D printing. I had the option to purchase a 3-D printer or attempt to build one. I thought that since I was in no rush, I should attempt to build one. I watched several videos you YouTube about building a printer. I thought that making a 3-D printer out of old DVD drives would be a cheap and easy way to build a printer. This is where the saga begins.
